"Design a modern, high-end, responsive website using the following top-tier UI/UX principles. The output should focus on clarity, spacing, strong visual hierarchy, and be fully accessible. Include thoughtful animations and PNG image assets only."

🎨 1. Typography System
Use REM units for scalability.

Sizes:

Paragraphs: 10px

Subtitles / Captions: 12px

Titles / Section Headers: 14px or 16px

Main Headings (H1–H2): Up to 32px, adjust by context.

Weights:

Paragraph: 400

Subhead: 500

Heading: 600–700

Line height: 1.6+ for small text.

No center alignment for paragraphs — use left alignment for readability.

Use visual hierarchy (size, weight, color) to guide attention in <3 seconds.

🧱 2. Color & Contrast
Use a minimal color palette:

text-dark, text-light

bg-light, bg-dark

primary-accent, secondary-accent

Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum).

High contrast between text and background.

Accent color should only highlight CTAs and key focus points.

Add subtle gradients only when needed to create depth — not decoration.

📏 3. Spacing System
Use this scale for margins, paddings:
[4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 40, 60, 100, 160, 240]

Allow more white space than you think; trim only after testing full layout.

Use spacing to group and simplify — based on Gestalt principles (proximity & similarity).

🧩 4. Component System
Buttons:

Primary: solid fill + bold font

Secondary: outline or ghost style

Padding: 12px 24px, border-radius: 8px

Cards:

Background: light or white

Shadow depth: soft drop shadows, no borders

Padding: 24–32px

Forms:

Full-width inputs with label, hint, and error

Use focus rings and transitions for inputs

All components must use shared tokens for font, color, and spacing.

🧭 5. Layout, Grid, Responsiveness
Use a 12-column fluid grid

Max content width: 720px (centered)

Use Z-pattern scanning for content-heavy pages.

Breakpoints:

Mobile: <=640px

Tablet: 641–1024px

Desktop: >1024px

Use media queries or responsive utilities to adapt typography, layout, and spacing.

🖼️ 6. Images & Assets
Use .png images with transparent backgrounds.

Maintain high resolution (2x or 3x for retina)

Icons: Use consistent icon set (outline or filled)

Avoid stocky illustrations; aim for subtle brand personalization

✨ 7. Animations & Motion
Use subtle, smooth animations (150–300ms)

Types:

Button hover: background + elevation change

Page transitions: fade-in or slide-in

Form input: focus animation + error shake (if needed)

Scroll-based reveal: fadeInUp, fadeInLeft, scaleIn

Use ease-in-out or cubic-bezier transitions

Keep animation accessible: no high motion, offer “reduce motion” fallbacks

♿ 8. Accessibility (a11y)
Ensure keyboard navigation for all interactive components

Use semantic HTML (button, nav, main, form, etc.)

Add aria-labels for non-text elements

Show clear focus indicators (outline or subtle shadow)

📱 9. Mobile UX Add-ons
Touch targets: Minimum 44px x 44px

Use bottom navigation or FAB for apps

Sticky headers and slide-in nav menus on scroll

Prevent scroll locking when modals are active

⚙️ 10. Design Philosophy
"Good design is as little design as possible."
Focus on usability, performance, and emotional clarity.
Use spacing, typography, and layout to reduce visual noise.
Hierarchy > Decoration. Simplicity > Flash.
